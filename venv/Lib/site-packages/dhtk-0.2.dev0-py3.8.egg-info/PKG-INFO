Description: # DHTK : Digital Humanities Toolkit
        
        A digital humanities library that is conceived to:
        - Seach data (such as books)
        - Do some common pre-treatement
        - Complete metadata of the data retained.
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Digital Humanities have the merit of connecting two very different disciplines such as humanities and computer science. 
        The Digital Humanities ToolKit (DHTK) has the scope to provide a fast and intuitive tool for a large- scale study of large literary databases 
        by leveraging on some well-known semantic knowledge resources. 
        
        In addition, DHTK has the ambition to go beyond textual resources to integrate other human resources such as images (e.g., paintings, comics, etc) or 
        sounds (e.g., music, transcripts, etc). 
        
        DHTK is a collaborative project and we invite anyone who has the interest or some ideas in this context to reach out to us.
